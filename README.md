# Question to be solved

1. Create a table with a large number of records (you can find it with a google search or use this link - https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db). Use MySQL Database.One can setup MySQL on localhost. Write some basic queries using python. Suppose you want to process/fetch a large number of records using python while keeping your memory usage low. Think of approaches on how to accomplish this and Implement.
Hint: Use Generator

2. Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a
method "get_gender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female
Class.

Bonus: Make class Person an abstract class and make get_gender an abstract method in the same class. The two child classes must inherit and implement get_gender. i.,e, When trying to initialize an object of class Person, the program must throw error.
Hint:
Use abc library (comes natively with Python3) https://www.python-course.eu/python3_abstract_classes.php

3. With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this list
after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.
Hint: Use set() to store a number of values without duplicates.

4. Write a program to generate a 3*5*8 3D array whose each element is 0.

5. Write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted list. The function
should return the index of element to be searched in the list.

6. Write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5
and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

7. Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com"
format, write a program to print the company name of a given email address. Both user
names and company names are composed of letters only.

8. Write a program which can map() to make a list whose elements are square of numbers
between 1 and 20 (both included).
Hints:
Use map() to generate a list.
Use Lambda to define anonymous functions.

9. Implement a program dir_tree.py that takes a directory as argument and prints all the files
in that directory recursively as a tree.
Hint: Use os.listdir and os.path.isdir functions.

10. Write an iterator class ReverseIter, that takes a list and iterates it from the reverse
Direction.

11. Write a program anti_html.py that takes a  URL as argument, downloads the html from web
and print it after stripping html tags.
